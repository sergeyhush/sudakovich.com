And so it begins...I have been making a good number of websites and web services in the past few years, but like barefoot shoemaker, never had time or desire to start my own. The time is now.
I intend to keep this strictly professional, no personal stuff. Things I learned, remembered and forgot or things I just generally want to share with others if they are interested in reading it.
